# Sign in error handling
# Data flows. Idea: Top views should get their required data for render 
directly from router/onSignInSuccess. This should be passed as param, and packaged by
identity. This way, access/top view data gets combined into one call, and thus top views
can render directly after this call is completed.

Following this, subviews can make their own seperate calls in their own logic for their own
view data. Top view will then be rendered, and the subview data loading will have to be
expressed with spinners/ui "preload"

Access needs:
- Can identity access view?
Top view data needs:
- Can identity access x/y/z?
- What is profile's name?
- What is profile's avatar?
